# AnimeApp
Our React Native application enables users to search, display, and manage information about anime, characters, and staff. It uses the React Hooks API, React Navigation library, and react-i18next for translations, supporting both English and Japanese languages. The application fetches data from a remote API and provides functionalities such as searching, adding, and deleting anime.

The AddAnime React Native component includes a form for adding an anime to the database with details such as title, synopsis, start date, end date, season, duration, rating, studio ID, and genre ID. The code utilizes GET requests to fetch the highest anime ID and validate the entered ID, while a POST request adds a new anime to the database upon successful input validation.

In summary, this React Native application offers a comprehensive interface for users to search and manage information about anime, characters, and staff, providing features such as searching for specific items, adding new anime, deleting existing anime, and switching between languages. The AddAnime component enables users to add a new anime to the database by fetching the highest anime ID, incrementing it, validating input, and making POST/GET/DELETE and PUT requests.

Our project then involved deploying a service by first purchasing a VPS on OVH with Ubuntu 18, which we then configured with SSH keys to allow remote connections without password authentication. We securely stored the private key on a laptop and used a client like PuTTY to connect to the VPS via the designated port. Upon logging into the VPS, we cloned the repository and installed the .NET framework. We then adjusted the appsettings.json file to connect to our AWS RDS database before building the application using the 'dotnet build' command. Finally, we configured the VPS to accept TCP connections on port 5000 using 'UFW allow 5000', and launched the application as its own process on the VPS using 'dotnet run'.
